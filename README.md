## Monzo Salary Sorter
Welcome to the Monzo Salary Sorter!

This is a demo project interacts with the Monzo API.
It is an attempt to convert the Python based application of the same name from @bhwood, you can find it [here](https://github.com/bhwood/monzo-salary-sorter).

### Usage

**Running the program:**

1. Ensure Java and Maven is installed.
2. The program requires a Monzo access token to be set as an environment variable.
You can set it in your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.zshrc` for Z shell).
Here's an example:

`export JAVA_MONZO_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_access_token>`

**Note:** Replace `<your_access_token>` with your actual Monzo access token.

### Disclaimer

I do not use Monzo, so I cannot test this locally with a working token.

**Have fun!**
